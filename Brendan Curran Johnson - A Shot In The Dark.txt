Reverse Engineering A Camera

Got my first camera a while ago
    I take more photos, but newer cameras, hopefully take better photos

Scene Mode:
    Presets for Various situations (sports, food, etc)
    Live Composite:


Camera has Open Source Remote API
    Very Insecure
    Private Spec is almost the exact same thing

    One of the commands tells you command you can use with the camera (including the parameters for each command)
