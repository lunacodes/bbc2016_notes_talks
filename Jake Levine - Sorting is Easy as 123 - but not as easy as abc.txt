Jake Levine - Sorting is Easy as 1-2-3, but not as easy as a-b-c!
Engineering Manager @ Meetup

Meetup added Support for Japanese last year:
    Flow:
        Present you with categories you might be interested in 
        Sorted in ABC order (easier to scan)
        We translated this into Japanese
            We got it wrong.  Japanese testers pointed this out

    Java sorting issue:
        Natural Sort on Arrays is easy
        Natural Sort for English Strings is easy
            Capital Letter strings end up in the wrong place for English Speakers
                Uppercase chars have different value than lower chars, and so they sort them differently

        Collator Class:
            Language Sensitive Sorting in Java

            usCollator = Collator.getInstance(new Locale("en", "US"))
                Sorts properly

            jaCollator = Collator.getInstance(new Locale("jp", "US"))
                This changes ordering, but still wasn't right


        Japanese Alphabets:
            Kanji - Symbols shared with chinese.  Each symbol represents concept.
            Hiragana, katakana, Romaji - Phonetic

            Ordering:
                50 Sounds Ordering
                    Gojuon (Hiragana) ordering
                    Can be used for Kanji
                        But Kanji symbols have context-dependent sound

                Currently No Reliable way for computers to sort this


        English:
            I'd like to READ vs. Have you READ
                Doesn't matter in English, but is relevant in Japanese


        Solution:
            De-coupled Language from display sorting
                Sorted into Alphabet
                24 Categories...

                ***Missed the Rest of the Explanation***

            This doesn't scale well.  We still need a human to translate every word.  Thousands-Million Words - impossible

            Maybe we could provide non-alphabetical spelling

            Amazon asks people to provide phoenetic versions of their name

Don't hinge your product design on length
If Global, don't make assumptions
