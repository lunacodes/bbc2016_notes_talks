Sketing Data Structures...
    Little less than Perfect that takes up less space

    You've probably worked with a Sketch at some point

    You might have specific Questions about a particular data set
        You can't answer these completely correctly without complete data set

    Bloom Filter
        Used in Google's Chrome
            Browser tool that figures out if a URL is Bad
            Google Has a Huge Database
                Too large to package with browsers
                So Google has compiled these into a Bloom Filter

            Bit Set + 3 Hash Functions (With Keys)

            Hash BadURL.com against the 3 bits to bitset, set those bits to 1
            Repeat AnotherBadURL.com - anything flipped to one stays one

            If GoodURL.com - one Hash is flipped at 0, so we know it's NOT bad

            NiceURL overlaps with Hashed keys that are all 1s
                Generates False Positive

                Otherwise, anything that's all zeros 

                The chance of one of these occurring
                    nItems ln false positive rate / # of bits per item
                    Just at 1,000 items, Bloom Filter takes up 24 MB


    Count-Min Sketch
        How many times does x appear in dataset (Approximate due to Unique Words)?

        3 Hash Functions
            Each Maps to its own Row of counters

        For each count, Incrememnt each row by + 1

        These counters represent the number of times we've incrememnted the word "cats", but also overlapping words

        This is an over-estimate, so we take the min. of the estimate

        Great for really popular items


Hyper Log Log Sketch
T-Digest Sket

Use when you have Large Data -> Small Summary
Unbounded Stream -> Bounded Memory

Embrace Randomness

Randomized Algorithms and problemistic data structures that help engage in randomness
