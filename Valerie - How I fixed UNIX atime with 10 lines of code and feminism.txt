Valerie - How I fixed UNIX atime with 10 lines of code and feminism
@frameshiftllc

 40 yr. old filesystem

Picture of me driving a tractor in 2006 while I was working on this code

Done file systems
Do Diversity and Inclusion


Every UNIX file has 3 timestamps:
    atime - access time
    mtime - modified time (last time written)
    ctime - Change Time (last time file was modified)

    Thanks NSA for showing us what metadata is

    Mail Reader
        atime >= mtime = no mail
        atime < mtime = new mail

    Memory = 100 nanoseconds - Corner Store
    SSD - EMpire Staate BUilding/DC
    Disk - Washington DC

    Reads can often be cached in Memory
    Writes have to go to SSD or Disk eventually

    1st Rule of Filesystem Club: Avoid Writes

UNIX atime:
    turns every read into a Write
        terrible waste of time

    "Atime updates are by far the biggest IO performancy defiency that Linux has today.  Getting rid of atime updates would give us more everyday..."
        ***Quotes***

    Non-Feminist Solution:
        No One Gets atime!!
        This would break a lot of stuff
        Power users would turn it off, but everyone else was screwed

        It would break that mail time update

        Whenever you'd complain about this, a bunch of sneering filesystem programmers would sneer at you about how you needed to not use atime
            lol - We could also rewrite our programs to not write filesystems *rolls eyes*

        Keep big list of everything in memory.  Lets wait till we're running out of memory and then write

                What Users wanted vs. File System, Data Strucutres & Code


    Feminist Solution (after 37 yrs):
        Linux Chicks - a place I had Psychological Safety
            Be Polite
            Be Helpful

        I listened to people
            Friends laptop was slow
            she turned off atime
            Mail app didn't work

            What did she really want to know
                Not the exact second?
                She just needed the relative time difference (before/after)

        Relative atime:
            Current atime <|> current mtime

            10 lines of code in Kernel
                So simple I refuse to patent it

                Some extra code to create mount compatability options
                    Update atime if > 1 day (so OS time-deletes files when necessary)



    Becoming a better feminist helped me become a better systems developer b/c I was more holistically focused

    I teach Ally Skills workshop
        Safer Spaces
        How to Listen
        How to center the person
