Colin Jones - Finding out what's really going on with DTrace!
@trptcolin

I really like it when computers work exactly like I expect
    Doesn't Help
    So I at least want to know why
    DTrace has been helping me

    Some Programming Language
        Let's you write programs to filter, aggregate/take other choices based on events

        Not Turing Comlpete
            No Loops
                This makes sure it will definitely stop/break loop


    This program looks like awk
        traces two kinds of events

        You can trace thigns that make sense for a given application like MySQL or JVM.

        MySQL drvs wrote code that let me run DTrace!!

        You can dynamically insert new instrumentation into Arbitrary C Functions
            Trace how long the Kernel takes to run
            Download Kernel Code
            Frequency Distribution Computing
                Orthogonical to what we're tracing, but interesting

    Problem: Show Tests
        These should be milliseconds - why are our tasks taking 30s

        Test Suite taking way too long

        Hypotheses
            GC Pauses
            Deadlocks
            Connection Pool Timeouts
            Sleep in the code that fires randomly

            We need actual information to solve this though

        Gather Data with DTrace to collect info to test hypotheses
        Modify Hypotheses


        Half the time JVM issues = Garbage Collection
            Can trace and print these out
        They were taking a while, but nowhere near the level that this was taking

        Higher Level:
            CPU 
                Kernel_Task - running by far the most
                    Pretty much all Idle
                    Java program only shows up 3 times
            Rules out any CPU stuff
                GCE 
                Tight Computational Loops
                Too many Threads
            Saves Time

            Ruled out Memory and Disk Slowness as well

            Networking
                Calls to the Database
                    Check Socket COnnections (Code for this is annoyingly complicated.  I couldn't write easily)
                        Thankfully it's free online!
                        Along with Socket COnnect Latency for everything

                Seeing latencies on the order of 20-40ms - so not our culprit

                But it's interesting we're connecting to an external host
                    This isn't in our config or code
                    Should only have been local connections

                    DNS trace
                        for some reason, was trying to connect to "someplace.com" url was taking 30s to resolve

        Solutions:
            Complain To ISP
            Replace DNS

            Actual Solution:
                Don't make external calls in our test suite

This isn't just a tool for performance issues
    DTrace is a great way to learn about your Computer (Kernel Code for example)
    Other OS's might have different, but similar tools
