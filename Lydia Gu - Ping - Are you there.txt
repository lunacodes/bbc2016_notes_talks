Ping! are you there?!

When feeling lonely, I ping google.com & feel great when I see how fast my internet connection is

History of Ping:
    The Story of the PING Program - Mike Muss (Creator)    


Brief overview of Networking:
    We use abstraction to handle complexity and data loss
    Each layer has a specific function and doesn't worry about the rest of the functions/protocols

    Transport - Retransmission, Congestion Control (TCP) - "What if your Pidgeon gets shot down?"
    Network - Routing (IP) - Where should you send it
    Data Link - Physical Connections (like Carrier Pigeons)


Operating Systems provide interfaces to these layers
    Socket -> Transport 
    Raw Socket -> Network (Ping uses this)
    Network Link -> Not great for Ping b/c there might not be a direct physical connection


PING:
    ICMP echo request
        Messaging protocol -> diagnostic and debugging btwn. computers
            Identify (Process ID)
            Sequence ID (Message Number)
            Data Field (Current Time Stamp)

            These are incorporated into server transmissions

            This is what PING displays


    Security Problems:
        Smurf Attack:
            DDoS (many computers used to overwhelm normal computer w/ Network Traffic)

            Takes Victim IP as Source
            Puts Network Broadcast Address as Destination
                All the computers re-echo that info back to the victim

                Creates never-ending feedback loop of Echo Requests :o
