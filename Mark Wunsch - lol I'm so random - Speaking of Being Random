*tech issues* -> Random stuff can happen


Randomness in Computing
    There's lots of it

Explained a lot:
    Javascript & Java are not same thing
    Math.random() produces random number in both
        Where does that number come from?
        Why is it this number

    **XKCD comic**


Random in Computers:
    COmputers = Binary
    Essentially a Head Flip
        How do we teach computer to flip a coin
            Nevermind - that's tedious

    Prior to COmputers:
        Book - "A Million Random Digits"
        Scientists would pick Random Numbers out of this book for Simulations
            You could re-use those same variations to reproduce those simulation results


    John Von Neuman
        No such thing as random numbers
        Computers can't generate random numbers
            Procedural Results can repeat
            Pseudo-Randomness: Computers generate numbers that appear Random

            Dice, etc:
                Physics are in play
                A Computer can't accurately reproduce

            Generators with seed produce results
                Running a generator with the same seeds produce the same results

            Mathematica:
                You can see what happens with the seed
                We get the approximation of noise

            Closure:
                Random()
                    Callsback to Math.Random() in Java
                        public static double random

            Mary Rose Cook: Fucntional Code is characterized by the absence of side effects
                Closure's approach creates a HUGE side effect

            Haskell
                Random(): takes a generator g
                    Returns a pair of random type a and another generator
                        Returns a random number and numeric representation of a generator
                    If we call this again, we get the same number
                        If we call with new generator, we get different result

            PRNG Algorithms

                    Twisted Linear Feedback Register
                    Mersenn Prime.
                        Prime number one less than a power of two
                        Period of PRNG
                            How long a sequence can repeat prior to repeating results

                    This is what Python, Ruby and Julia are based off of.

                Choice of PRNG matter in subtle ways

                    V8 - Javascript Engine of Chrome and Node
                        Last year they discovered that their PRNG wasn't that great, and improved it

        Cryptographic Security:
            Creates nonses for keys
            You need these number to be hard to pick
            PRNG is often used
            There are algorithms for this
