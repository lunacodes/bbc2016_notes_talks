Sher Minn Chong - Plants Are Recursive

From Malaysia - flew from halfway around the world
Spent time at Recurse Center last year

Plants and Recursion

Recursion
    Replication in a self-similar way
    Koch-Snowflake
    Taking edge and replace it with another version of that curve

Recursion In Nature
    Fractals
        Each point looks like a tiny version of itself
        Each branch of a Fern Leaf
        Freckled Broccoli


Aristid Lindenmayer - Biologist who noticed this recursion


L-Systems
    String Rewriting System
    Axiom 
    Rules: 
    A
    A -> Ab
    B -> A


L-Systems are great for Recursive Patterns

You can use this visually
    String-> Drawing

    F - draw a line
    + Rotate Clockwise by Angle
    - Rotate Counter-Clockwise by andle



Applications for Game Dev where we need Complex Patterns but don't necessarily want to write a ton of code
