Irving Hwang - Making a Metaverse! A WebVR (not so M)MO for Programmers

Used to go to game stores a lot as 12 yr old
    Had my first experience with VR
        Wasn't that impressed
        Even when Occulus Kickstarte came out, I didn't feel that excited

    Saw Riffsketch on Kickstarter
        Something Clicked and I felt Futuristic
        I couldn't pinpoint what it was that felt so compelling
            It's this highly potential, Rich medium for creativity and exploration
            World where you can create objects out of air and breath life into them
            Becoming the Wizard on the cover of SICP - that seems a lot more real


    Construct Club
        Virtual Reality 3D graphics program I created
            I didn't know much about that stuff, and I'm still a novice

        Meteor.js
            Library for doing 3d Graphics in Browser in Javascript

        three.js
            ...

        Some other library

        **Live Demo**
            2 accounts connected to same site
            Each window's changes affect the world (and thus, other Windows)

            Objects in world = Programs
            Programs = Data
                Each object is controlled by a different program (Entries stored in a Database)
                Program = String of text.  Initialization and Update Functions
                    Name

            Javascript eval
                Awesome, but dangerous
                Change initialization functions with this

            Rendering Loop
                Responsible for drawing each of these images
                Calls each program's update loop


I want to use this for programming education
    Went to talk recently by John Iwada
        Marketing Lead
"Greatest Industry of Future will be Education.  2nd will be Entertainment.  I think the two should be put together"

This would be great for classroom dynamics
    Level of community and Intimacy in Classrooms added, that we don't currently have

What kind of changes does this make to other things we have online
    How does this influence APIs and applications?
        Weather
        Email
        Facebook
        Soundcould
        Google Chrome

        VR right now is where the internet was in the early 90s.  We have no idea what will come from it

If you create a platform and give people the room to create, awesome things will come of it
