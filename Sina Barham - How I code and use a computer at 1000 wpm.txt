Thanks so much to MIRABI for being the best transcriber!!

Turns music on - this is how I use computers

He can process hearing 1,900 minutes or so :o

How a Screen Reader Works:
    Pitch changes based on Character Case
        Multi-Dimensional Information
        Saves unnecessary things like "Capital S"

    Cut control plus x unavailable
        Unavailable is semantic

    Semantic Elements:
        Using link and styling like a button
        It's not the native button element - you lose native Button Semantics
        It's like holding up an image of a doorway and expecting people to be able to walk through it

    I've got a headless interface to twitter 


    Headings in Web Design:
        Headings are STRUCTURAL
            They're not for making things Bigger
            They are for tab navigation

        Wrap these things in <h> or <article> tags

    Via tab Navigation can nagivate this
        ***Using these <h> tags and coding logic, you can make this accessible to Blind People***

    Ads suck especially if you're blind

    Ars Technica - Good
    Hacker News - Not Friendly
    Reddit - Fairly Accessible

    My experience of Software is mediated through Software
        My Screen Reader
        This is true of Search Engines, etc
            Implement accessibility and you increase SEO, Page Rank, etc.

    Include Full descriptions of Image in <alt> tags

    W3C Accessibility Guidelines
        Web Content Acessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0
            AMAZING ADVICE

iPhone Accessibility
    Built In:
        Screen Reader
        TTY
        Even features for people who can't use their hads

        I can use specific hand gestures to turn the screen curtain off and shut off the backlight, so I get way better battery life than you!!
